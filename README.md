# Overview
In this project, we make use of the embedded Watson AI libraries, to create an application that would perform sentiment analysis on a provided text. We then deploy the said application over the web using Flask framework.

Please note that this project uses Embeddable Watson AI libraries that have been pre-installed on Skills Network Labs Cloud IDE where this was created. These libraries may also be accessed through your personal systems. The guidelines for the same are available on the Watson AI library page.
